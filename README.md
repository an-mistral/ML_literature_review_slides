# AI/ML Talks & Literature Reviews

This repository contains academic slide decks (seminar talks and literature reviews) on advanced AI/ML topics in medical imaging. These presentations are summaries of research concepts, showcasing my ability to explain modern ML methods.

- `Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging` *(Slides)*: Survey of Vision Transformer architectures (ViT and variants like TransUNet) applied to medical image analysis, highlighting differences from CNNs and practical use cases.
- `Graph Neural Networks in Medical Imaging` *(Slides)*: Overview of graph-based deep learning techniques for medical images, covering graph construction, message passing, and example applications.
- `Deep Learning for HCC Histology Prognosis (Paper Review)`: Summary of a research study using deep learning on histopathology to predict hepatocellular carcinoma patient outcomes (survival analysis and prognostic modeling).
  
*(Each deck is a concise literature review)*
